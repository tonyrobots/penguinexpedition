  title: Out of Food
  copy: 'The food has run out, and Charlie, grumbling about your leadership decides
    to strike out on his own. I tried to tell him it was a suicidal folly, but he
    wouldn''t hear it.


    We managed to gather some scraps from an old rucksack,
    so it wasn''t a total loss.

    It''s one fewer mouth to feed, at least.'
